# 46 solutions to  Torbjörn Lager's 46 problems (well currently 25)

Earlier this week I found this [list](http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/python_exercises.html) of simple python problems from Torbjörn Lager and have been doing a few problems every day. The problems are all very simple to understand and have many possible solutions. A great brain and Python workout.
